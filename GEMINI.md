This is a spring boot project. It will be organized under 3 base packages: common, bet and jackpot.
The common package will have anything that doesn't belong to any specific domain, such as configuration classes.
The bet package will contain all classes related to betting functionality, such as services, repositories, models and controllers for handling bets.
The jackpot package will include classes related to jackpot functionality, such as services, repositories, models and controllers.

Document all public classes and methods using Javadoc comments.
Use Java records instead of Java classes whenever possible.
